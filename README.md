SideRide is a vehicle-sharing web application designed to facilitate carpooling, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS. The platform allows users to create and join rides, providing a simple and efficient way for people to share their journeys. Users can easily view ride details, including start and end locations, vehicle information, available seats, and ride timings. They can also track their ride history and file complaints if needed.

Admins have a dedicated login to monitor all rides, manage user activity, and view complaints filed by users, ensuring the smooth operation of the platform. SideRide aims to provide a seamless carpooling experience with an intuitive user interface and efficient ride management features.
